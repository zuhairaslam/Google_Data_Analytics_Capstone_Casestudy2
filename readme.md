# Google Data Analytics Capstone Casestudy 2

## A case study on the Bellabeat's fitbit data

### This repository contains an analysis done for the capstone project 2 of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate course offered on Coursera. In this case study, I used data from BellaBeat, which is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, to try to understand and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart device.  I was able to deliver recommendations by providing insights using this smart device fitness data which could help the company to unlock new growth opportunities.
